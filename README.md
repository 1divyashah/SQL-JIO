Description

SQL databases have become a popular and efficient tool for managing organizational data, particularly in HR departments. With separate tables for different types of data, HR Technical Managers can easily access information about employees, payroll, benefits, and more. By using SQL queries on the database, they can quickly identify trends and patterns in the data, helping them make informed decisions about staffing, benefits, and expenses.

Using SQL databases also helps HR Technical Managers maintain data accuracy and integrity. By using data validation techniques and setting up automated processes for data entry and validation, they can reduce the risk of errors and discrepancies, making their overall processes more efficient. SQL databases have become an essential tool for HR Technical Managers in organizations of all sizes, allowing for centralized data storage and management, helping them make informed decisions, and improving overall efficiency.
In our case study of Reliance Jio Digital's Employee Management System, we have two tables: 'Employee' and 'Department'. The 'Employee' table contains four columns: 'Emp_ID', 'First_Name', 'Last_Name', and 'Dept_Code'. The 'Department' table, on the other hand, has three columns: 'Dept_Code', 'Dept_Name', and 'Dept_Budget'. Both tables are connected through the 'Dept_Code' column in the 'Employee' table and the 'Dept_Code' column in the 'Department' table, which serves as a foreign key in the 'Employee' table and a primary key in the 'Department' table.

Using SQL queries on the database, HR Technical Managers at Reliance Jio can easily access and manage information related to employee details and department budgets, helping them make informed decisions regarding staffing and expenses. By using SQL databases, they can maintain data accuracy and integrity, reduce errors and discrepancies, and improve overall efficiency in HR processes.
